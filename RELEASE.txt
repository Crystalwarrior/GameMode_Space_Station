This is an unstable development copy, used for me to work between computers and for others to contribute. This is not a stable release with support. Nobody is obligated under any terms to help you run this on your server; if you can't figure it out yourself, you probably shouldn't be trying. Under any condition, attempting to run this is entirely your own decision. Whether it deletes all your files or simply doesn't work is your problem.
